# Hackreactor Connect - HR44 MVP Solo project



### Findings:
- for detailed reports on lessons learned / insights into aframe and aframe-react as well as the other used component libraries, see `README-FINDINGS.md`


### This project makes use of aframe-react-boilerplate

- NOTE: this was used to save time on webpack and dependency setup, all react / aframe components provided were edited / customized / re-written.
- to reiterate: all code to do with dynamically slicing data, rendering complex layouts and nested layouts, working with data etc was written custom for this project.

An [aframe-react](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react) boilerplate, combining [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) with React.

- feel free to use my modified version as a boilerplate for your projects!
